# Plugins

A new plugin-system has been implemented in the fwuploader. A plugin is basically another executable/tool, specifically
tailored for a board/family of boards, but with a well-defined user interface. Inside the plugin, there is all the
business logic to support a board/family of boards. Every plugin implements the
[interface](https://github.com/arduino/fwuploader-plugin-helper/blob/main/plugin.go#L28) contained in the
[fwuploader-plugin-helper](https://github.com/arduino/fwuploader-plugin-helper) repository.

The fwuploader is still responsible for downloading the files required for the plugin to work:

- plugins/tools
- certificates
- firmware

The new information is hosted in the
[plugin_firmware_index.json](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-fwuploader/boards/plugin_firmware_index.json), which
is generated by `generator.py`.

### Known issues

#### Espflash panic `UnknownModel`

On some arm64 Linux distros, version 2.0.0 of [espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/) might panic with the
following error:

```
Error:   Ã— Main thread panicked.
  â”œâ”€â–¶ at espflash/src/interface.rs:70:33
  â•°â”€â–¶ called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: UnknownModel
  help: set the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a
        backtrace.
```

#### The esp32 module does not go into download mode

On Linux, the uno r4 must be plugged into a **hub usb** to make the flash process work. Otherwise, it wonâ€™t be able to
reboot in download mode.

```bash
$ arduino-fwuploader firmware flash -b arduino:renesas_uno:unor4wifi -a /dev/ttyACM0 -v --log-level debug

#### I flashed the certificates, but I am unable to reach the host

The **whole certificate chain** is needed to make it work. Using `-u` flags (ex: `-u www.arduino.cc:443`) wonâ€™t work
because it only downloads the root certificates. The solution is to use only the `-f` flag and provide a pem certificate
containing the whole chain.

#### My antivirus says that `espflash` is a threat

The binary is not signed [#348](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/issues/348), and some antiviruses might complain. If
still doubtful, https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash is open source, and it's possible to double-check the md5 hashes of
the binary and the source code. For more information, you can follow
[this](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/radio-module-firmware-version-0-2-0-is-now-available/1147361/11) forum thread.

#### Not running on armv7

At the moment, we are always downloading the armv6 binaries. Since they are dynamically linked, most likely they are not
going to run on armv7. More infos on the topic:
