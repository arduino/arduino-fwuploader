type: go
summary: 'Sortutil is a Go library which lets you sort a slice without implementing
  a sort.Interface, and in different orderings: ascending, descending, or case-insensitive
  ascending or descending (for slices of strings.) Additionally, Sortutil lets you
  sort a slice of a custom struct by a given struct field or index--for example, you
  can sort a []MyStruct by the structs'' "Name" fields, or a [][]int by the second
  index of each nested slice, similar to using sorted(key=operator.itemgetter/attrgetter)
  in Python.'
